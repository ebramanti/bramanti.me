  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I am Edward Bramanti, a software engineer passionate about JavaScript and the Web.
    I am currently focused on React and Node.js at VideoAmp, and working to push myself
    and my team to the next level. I enjoy discussing functional programming in JavaScript
    and learning new programming languages. I am extremely excited about boring stuff like
    test-driven development and ESLint and am constantly look for ways to increase my
    certainty of code correctness. I strive to be an ethical programmer who balances speed
    with excellent program design.
