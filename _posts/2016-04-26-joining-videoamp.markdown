I am very excited to announce that I will be joining [Videoamp](http://videoamp.com), an advertising technology startup, in May.

I will be working on their API team to enhance their existing Node.js API. It marks a culmination of the experience I have with Javascript and Node over the past couple of years.

Videoamp is doing some incredible things in the ad-tech space right now with optimizing how customers buy, measure, and optimize effectiveness of their video advertisements. Their [recent $15m Series A in November](http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/videoamp-raises-15m-series-a-funding-led-by-rtl-group-545738922.html) reinforces how amazing the opportunity to be working with the company is at this critical moment.

I am humbled to join such an awesome team, and I can't wait to tackle the exciting challenges ahead.
