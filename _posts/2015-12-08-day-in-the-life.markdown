I just gave a talk to LMUCS's Class of 2016 in CMSI 401 titled _A Day in the Life_, talking about what I like to work on, where I work and how I got a job using the skills I acquired from LMU.

[Here's a link to the slides in PDF of the talk I gave](https://www.dropbox.com/s/96dzvbq1hg2rjkf/A%20Day%20in%20the%20Life.pdf?dl=0).

**To those who heard this talk**: I originally planned an awesome Node.js API talk, but instead of cramming your brains any more full than they are I wanted to provide you all with some practical advice in the hunt for a job. In addition, I want to encourage you all to get outside your comfort zone, contribute to open-source and realize how awesome we have it as software engineers today. 

Thanks for having me, and I wish you all the best in your studies and job search in the upcoming semester!
