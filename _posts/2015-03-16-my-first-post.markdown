I finally decided to get my own personal blog going using [Ghost](ghost.org). I am using [Runkite's](runkite.com) awesome service for hosting the Ghost server. Setup was quick and painless, with features such as custom domain linking and easy control over creation of new blog posts.

I am super excited to finally have a space to post my thoughts on all things software development. If you are interested in seeing my work, follow me on [Github](github.com/jadengore)!
