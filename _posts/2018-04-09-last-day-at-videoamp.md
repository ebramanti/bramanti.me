_This post is a couple days delayed (my last day was Friday), but these are my thoughts from last week._

Today is my last day at VideoAmp.

I want to specifically thank my mentors (Drew, Ross and Dave) for their guidance, and the fullstack team for
their trust and encouragement. VideoAmp is a unique place where you will learn more than you think you can,
and I am very grateful to the team for giving me a chance to be a part of their story for the past two years.
I am very confident that VideoAmp will solve the most difficult problems of linear and digital advertising because
of the amazing people that work there and the team's hunger to win in this space.

Here's to what's next!
